# Vercel Analytics Setup & Configuration

## âœ… Problem Fixed

Your Vercel Analytics was showing no data because the analytics tracking was not properly installed and configured. I've now implemented a comprehensive analytics solution.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Core Vercel Analytics Installation**
- âœ… Installed `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` packages
- âœ… Added `<Analytics />` and `<SpeedInsights />` components to `app/layout.tsx`
- âœ… Created `vercel.json` configuration with analytics settings

### 2. **Advanced Custom Analytics System**
- âœ… Created comprehensive `lib/analytics.ts` with typed event tracking
- âœ… Integrated analytics throughout the main `SplitsaveApp` component
- âœ… Added performance monitoring and error tracking

### 3. **Event Tracking Categories**

#### **User Authentication & Journey**
- `user_signup` - Track new user registrations
- `user_login` / `user_logout` - Track authentication events
- `page_view` - Track page visits with authentication status

#### **Financial Actions**
- `expense_added` - Track expense creation with category and approval status
- `goal_created` - Track goal creation with category and target amount
- `goal_contribution` - Track goal contributions with amounts
- `goal_completed` - Track goal completions
- `safety_pot_contribution` / `safety_pot_withdrawal` - Track safety pot actions

#### **Partnership & Social**
- `partnership_created` / `partnership_joined` - Track partnership events
- `activity_reaction` / `activity_comment` - Track social engagement
- `tab_switched` - Track navigation between sections

#### **Gamification & Achievements**
- `achievement_unlocked` - Track achievement progress
- `level_up` - Track level progression
- `streak_milestone` - Track streak achievements

#### **Performance & Technical**
- `performance_issue` - Track Core Web Vitals issues
- `error_occurred` - Track application errors
- `feature_used` - Track feature adoption

### 4. **Configuration Files**

#### **`vercel.json`**
```json
{
  "analytics": { "enable": true },
  "speedInsights": { "enable": true },
  "functions": { "app/api/**": { "maxDuration": 30 } },
  "headers": [/* Security and caching headers */]
}
```

#### **`lib/analytics.ts`**
- Typed event system with TypeScript interfaces
- Helper classes for different analytics categories
- React hook for component-level usage
- Environment-based tracking (only in production)

### 5. **Integration Points**

#### **Main App (`SplitsaveApp.tsx`)**
- âœ… Page view tracking on user authentication
- âœ… Navigation tracking between tabs
- âœ… Expense creation tracking
- âœ… Goal creation tracking

#### **Ready for More Integration**
- Activity feed interactions
- Achievement unlocks (when gamification triggers)
- Error boundaries
- Performance monitoring
